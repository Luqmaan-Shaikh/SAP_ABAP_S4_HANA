*** Day 2 (13/01/2025)


# Architecture -

-> Tier 3 (R/3) :-

1. Presentation -> Reports (Se38) 
	- if Se38 , then goes to Application layer
2. Application -> Buffer Zone (Acting as a Temp Memory Unit)
	- if data present in BZ -> Presentation
	- if data not present , data goes to DB Layer , then goes to BZ, stores there , then Presentation
3. Database Layer


-> Tier 2 (R/2) :-

1. Presentation and Application Layer - Combined 1 Layer (both P and A)
2. Database Layer


-> Tier 1  (R/1) :- 

1. Presentation and Application and Database Layer - Combined 1 Layer (all 3) 


# Landscape -

Some Companies will have - SANDBOX 
1. Development System - all kinds of dev and customization will be done (ABAPer will have access to this system) (only 20% of Data will be present)
2. Quality System - all testing will be done here (35 - 40 % data will be present)
Some Companies will have - PRE PRODUCTION 
3. Production System - final system (100% of data)

- Flow of work :- 

-> Transport Request 
	- Developing something (we will do it under a package) 
	- Create a package (Se21) -> All those programs under this package 
	- We will get Alpha-numeric Code (12 or 16 digits) -> This code is called as Transport Request

# SQL :- 

1. DDL :- Create , Alter
2. DML :- Insert , Update , Modify , Delete
3. DCL :- Commit , Rollback


- SQL is Database Dependent and SAP is Database Independent

-> SAP doesn't support SQL
-> Open SQL supports SAP , because open SQL is database independent
-> Open SQL doesn't support DDL  -> cant create tables by using simple statements like oracle
-> Open SQL support DDIC (Data Dictionary) -> which is used to create or alter table




------>>>>>> DATA DICTIONARY :-

- Central source of DBMS 
- Main functionality of DDIC is to create or alter tables

-> 2 ways to create DB Table :-

1. Direct method / pre defined / built in [We Don't use this]
2. Data Element Method (TD Approach , BU Approach)



-> Technical Requirements to create Table :- 
	- Name of table starts with y or z 
	- Provide list of fields, data types and lengths
	- Provide the delivery class
	- Provide the Technical settings



-> Delivery Class :-
- It defines the owner of the tables as well as it controls the transport of the data from one table to another table 
- Technical settings is nothing but the combination of DATA CLASS and SIZE OF THE CATEGORY


-> Data Class :- 
- Data Class defines the physical area of the DB in where our table is logically stored

- Some of the important Data Classes are :-

1. APPL 0 - Master Data = Access Frequently But Updates Rarely (Customer master data, employee master data)
2. APPL 1 - Transaction Data = Access Rarely and Updates Rarely (Sales order , Purchase Order Data) . Technical Data is Dependent Data.
3. APPL 2 - Organization Data = Access Frequently But Updates Rarely (Company Data , Branches Data) . Organizational data is created at the time of system configures.



-> Size Category 
- It determines the space require for the table. 
- Size category : 0
- Each table must have at least one field as primary field that should be the character data type that should be character data type that should in th first field in the table


--->> 1. Direct Method

- Save Technical Settings 
- Click on Back
- Then Activate Table (CTRL F3)


--->> 2. Data Element


-> Domain :- Collection of Data Types with their lengths 
-> Data Element :- Collection of Domain with Short Description


1. Bottom Up :- Create Domain -> Create Data Element -> Create table -> Place data element in the table -> Check and Activate the table -> Giving Records
2. Top Down :- Create Table -> Place data element in the table / Giving Fields -> Create Data Element -> Create Domain -> Check and Activate the table -> Giving Records



-> Steps to Create Domain :- 

- Execute SE11
- Select Radio Button Domain
- Provide Domain name by clicking on create
- Provide short description
- Provide Data Type & length
- Save the domain
- Check Domain
- Activate Domain
- Repeat same steps for all domain



-> Steps to Create Data Element :-

- Provide Data Element Name
- Click on Create
- Click on Enter
- Provide Short Description
- Provide Domain which is already created
- Save Data Element
- Check Data Element
- Activate Data Element
- Repeat same steps for all the Data Element



-> Steps to create table using Data Element Method :-

- For Table -> We Require Fields :- Data Types and Length -> We need Domain :- Char and 20 -> We need Data Element :- Domain Name and Short Description


- Table -> Short Desc , Delivery Class , Display/maintenance Allow  -> Fields (Data Elements) -> Technical Settings (Data Class [appl 0], Size Category [0]) -> Extra [ Enhancement Category (Can be Enhanced Deeply :- Both Number and Character can be inputted in the field) -> Save]

# Creating a Record :- 

Utilities -> Table Contents -> Create Entries 



# SM30 -> TMG () :- DML Operation [update , delete, modify Table]

# Foreign Key 

1st Table is called CHECK TABLE
2nd Table is called VALUE TABLE

-> Field in one table 
-> Connected to another table via foreign key R/S
-> Purpose is to validate data being entered in in table (FK table) by checking against list of possible values in another table

- Technical Requirements to establish FK R/S :
1. Domain of both fields in both Table must be same
2. Check Table field must be the primary

- Steps :-

1. Execute SE1
2. Select Radio Button Database Object
3. Provide FK Table name
4. Click on Change
5. Select Field for which we want establish the FK Relation 
6. Click on FK Icon under fields tab
7. Provide Check Table Name
8. Click on Generate Proposal
9. Then the system automatically provides relation btw two tables
10. Save, Check, Activate the Table

- Vendor IFSC - char - 20


# Types of Table :-

1. Transparent Tables [We use this]

-> One - to - One R/s
-> If you create one transparent table in DDIC, then it'll store like only one data table in the data base
 
2. Cluster Tables

-> Many - to - One R/s
-> If you create many clustered tables in DDIC then they will form a table cluster and store in the data base
-> Buffering isn't possible for clustered table. For this reason only fetching the data from clustered table takes more time
-> Clustered table is suitable when you fetch the fewer amounts of data from more fields

3. Pool Tables

-> Many - to - One R/s
-> If you create many pooled tables in DDIC, then they will form form like a table pool and stored in the data base
-> Pooled tables are suitable when we fetch the large amount of data from fewer fields

NOTE:- Joins aren't possible for clustered and Pooled Tables


# Index :- 

-> Used to improve performance of select query

2 types :-

1. Primary Index :-

-> Primary Fields 
-> w/o P I we cant create data base table
-> up to 16 P I per Table
-> only for Custom Tables , not for standard

2. Secondary Index

-> possible for other than primary fields
-> w/o S I we can create a data base table
-> We can create up to 9 S I per Table
-> For Both Custom and Standard

Create Secondary Index :- 

1. Execute SE11
2. Select Radio Button Data base table
3. Provide Table name for which table we want to display
4. Click on display
5. Click on Index beside Technical Settings
6. Click on Create Index
7. Provide Index Name
8. Enter
9. Provide Short Description
10. Click on table fields 
11. Select require fields
12. Enter , Save , Check , Activate

Total 25 Keys = 16 PI + 9 SI

NOTE:- We cant delete domain which is already assigned to data elements. We cant delete the data element which is already assigned to data base table


# Some Standard Tables :

1. T001
- BUKRS company code
- BUTXT Company name
- ORT01 City
- LAND1 - Country 

2. KNA1
- KUNNR Customer Name
- NAME1 - Name
- ORT01 - City
- LAND1 - Country
- SPARS - Language

3. LFA1
- LIFNR Vendor Number
- NAME1 Name
- ORT01 City
- LAND1 Country
- SPARS Language

## FOR CUSTOM TABELS:- 

# ADD some additional Fields to the data base table [Already existing Table]

-> Create structure , include structure 
-> Same Structure can be used in N no. of custom Fields
-> All steps of include structure saved either in our own package ot in $TMP package

## FOR STANDARD TABLES:-

# ADD some additional Fields to the data base table [Already existing Table]

-> By using Append Structure we can add additional fields to standard data base table
-> Same Structure can be appended to only one standard data base table 
-> All steps of append structure must be saved in our own package only. Because $TMP is non transportable


#           Database Table                                    VS                 Structure 

-> DBT Must contain at least one field as Primary Field       VS         Structure Doesn't contain any Primary Fields
-> DBT contains Permanent Data                                VS         Structure doesn't contain any data
-> We must provide the size of the table in DBT               VS         We only need to provide size of the structure
-> We must provide Delivery Class tot DBT                     VS         We do no need to provide the Delivery Class to the structure 


# Steps to create the Structure :-

1. Execute SE11
2. Select Radio Button Data Type
3. Provide Structure Name
4. Click on Create
5. Select Radio Button Structure 
6. Enter
7. Provide Short Desc
8. Provide Component , Component Type


# Steps to include the same structure in any number of custom tables :-

1. Execute SE11
2. Select Radio Button Data Base Table 
3. Provide Table Name
4. Click on change
5. Place Cursor where you want tot include the structure 
6. Provide Field Name ".include"
7. Provide the Data Elements as Structure Name
8. Enter , Save , Check , Activate




*** Day 4 (17/01/2025)


# Syntax of declaring the structure / table in ABAP Editor :-
->
Data: Begin of </Structure /table>,
      ------,
      ------,            Field Name
      ------,
      End of </Structure /table>.

Ex :- 
->
Data: Begin of emp,
      eid(10) type c,  
      ename(25) type c,
      ecity(30) type c,                  Work Area
      ecntno(10) type numc,
      End of emp.

-> Work Area always hold one record at a time 
-> So we go for internal tables


# Internal Tables ******************** :-

1. Internal Tables is the collection of Records.
2. IT are Temporary Tables. Means Data in IT wont be saved anywhere in SAP.
3. IT are Dynamic Memory Location. Means we don't have to provide size of IT.
4. Scope of IT is up to that program.
5. Placing Data to IT as well as getting data from IT is always record by record.


#           Database Table                  VS             Internal Table

- DBT are Permanent Storage Location        VS       IT are Temporary Storage Location
- We can Access DBT from anywhere in SAP    VS      We can Access IT within the Program only
- We must provide Size of DBT               VS      IT are Dynamic, Need not provide the size


# Syntax of declaring IT :-
-> 
Data <internal table> LIKE table of <work area>.

# Ex:- 
-> 
Data IT like table of WA.

# Syntax of accessing fields from Work Area
-> 
<work area name> - <field name>.

# Ex :-
-> 
WA - Eid.

NOTE -> APPEND is the Keyword to Transfer the data from work area to IT


# Ex :- 
->
Data: Begin of emp,
      eid(10) type c,  
      ename(25) type c,
      ecity(30) type c,
      ecntno(10) type numc,
      End of emp.
Data IT like table of WA.
WA-Eid = '1'.

# Syntax of Declaring the Field :- 
-> 
Data <field name> (<length>) type <data type>.

# Ex.
-> 
Data BUKRS(4) type c.

OR

-> 
Data <field name> type <data element>.

# Ex.
-> 
Data BUKRS type BUKRS.

OR

-> 
Data <field name> type <data base table> - <field name>. [WE will be using this one]

# Ex.
-> 
Data BUKRS type T001-BUKRS. 

-> 
Data Matnr type MARA-Matnr.

# Select-options (We use S_ ):- 

-> Select-options is the keyword which accepts single vale, multiple values, single range and multiple ranges


# Syntax of Select-options :- 
-> 
Select-options <name of the select-options> for <variable name>.

Ex:-
-> 
Data v1 for BUKRS.
Select-options S_BUKRS for v1.

-> 
Data v2 for KNA1-KUNNR.
Select-options S_KUNNR for v2.

-> 
Data v3 for marc-matnr.
Select-options S_matnr for v3.


# Syntax of Select-options in Select Query:- 
-> 
Select <field1> <field2> ... from <database table> into table <Internal Table> where <field> in <select-options>.

# Ex :-
-> 
REPORT ZLUQMAAN_P5.
Data v1 type T001-Bukrs.
SELECT-OPTIONS S_BUKRS for v1.
Data: Begin of WA_T001,
  BUKRS type T001-BUKRS,
  BUTXT type T001-BUTXT,
  ORT01 type T001-ORT01,
  End of WA_T001.
Data IT_T001 like table of WA_T001.
Select BUKRS BUTXT ORT01 from T001 into table IT_T001 where BUKRS in S_BUKRS.
LOOP at IT_T001 into WA_T001.

# Parameter :-

# Syntax
-> 
Parameter <name of parameter> type <data type> 
 
# Ex:-
->
parameter P_BUKRS type T001-BUKRS.

# Syntax of Parameter in Select Query :-
-> 
Select <field1> <field1> ... from <database table> into table <Internal Table> where field = <parameter>.

# Ex :-
->
Select BUKRS BUTXT LAND1 from T001 into table IT_001 where BUKRS = P_BUKRS.



# 			Parameter 		          VS 			Select-options 

-> P is Keyword which accepts single value at run time    VS          S-o is Keyword which accepts single value , multiple single values , single range , multiple ranges
-> Without P input parameter we cant get data             VS          Without providing input select-options we can get the entire data from DB 


# Types of Internal Table :

1. Indexed 
	- Standard
	- Sorted
2. Hashed


# Standard IT :-

-> Accepts Duplicate Records
-> Here all fields are Non-Unique
-> Passing Data from work area to IT is always through 'Append' Keyword
-> Searching of a Record is Linear Search

# Syntax :-
->
Data <IT> like standard table of <work area>.


# Sorted IT :-

-> May or may not accept Duplicate Records
-> Here we must specify at least one field as Unique / Non-Unique
-> Passing Data from work area to IT is always through 'Insert' Keyword
-> Searching of a Record is Binary Search

# Syntax :-
->
Data <IT> like sorted table of <work area> with unique / non-unique key <filed>.

#Ex :-
->
Data IT like sorted table of WA with unique key Eid.


# Hashed IT :-

-> Wont accept Duplicate Records
-> Here we must specify at least one field as Unique
-> Passing Data from work area to IT is always through 'Collect' Keyword
-> Searching of a Record is Hash Algorithm

# Syntax :-
->
Data <IT> like hash table of <work area> with unique key Eid.


# Kind is the keyword which returns type of IT 
- Standard (T) , Sorted (S) , Hash (H)

# Lines is the keyword which returns the no of records in IT

# Syntax :-
->
Describe table <internal name> KIND <variable1> LINES <variable2>.

# Ex :-
->
Describe table IT_KNA1 KIND v1 LINES v2.

NOTE -> By Default variable is the character data type and length is 1
NOTE -> By Default IT is Standard IT (T)


# Types of Declaring IT :- 

1. Declaring IT with some of the fields from any one of the dbt :- 

# Ex :-
->
Data: begin of wa_t001,
bukrs type t001-bukrs,
ort01 type t001-ort01,
end of wa_t001.
Data IT like table wa_t001.

2. Declaring IT with all fields from any one of the dbt :-

# Syntax 
-> 
Data begin of <work area>.
Include Structure <DBT>.
Data end of <work area>.
Data <I T> like table of <work area>.

# Ex :-
->
Data begin of wa_t001.
Include Structure t001.
Data end of wa_t001.
Data it_t001 like table of wa_t001.

3. Declaring IT table by Referring DBT (Rarely we use this)

# Syntax :-
->
Data <w a> like <dbt>.
Data <I T> like table of <w a / dbt>

# Ex :-
->
Data wa like t001.
Data it like table of wa.

OR

->
Data IT like table of t001.
Data wa like line of IT.
